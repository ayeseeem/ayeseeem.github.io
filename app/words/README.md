Distribution of Words in English by First Letter(s)
===================================================

I am interested by\* how hard it is to guess where to open a dictionary to look up
a word.

- \* I say "by", not "in", deliberately.
  I think "in" implies that it _is_ hard
  (which I _feel_ it is, but I'm not sure),
  whereas "by" includes the possibility of _whether_ it is hard
  (which I feel it _is_, but I'm not sure).

I'm considering an interactive dictionary "game" where you have to click to see
where you think a letter would appear in the dictionary.

Before creating that, I'm just gathering some initial data and seeing what it
looks like.
