Distribution of Words in English by First Letter(s)
===================================================

I am interested by how hard it is to guess where to open a dictionary to look up
a word.

I'm considering an interactive dictionary "game" where you have to click to see
where you think a letter would appear in the dictionary.

Before creating that, I'm just gathering some initial data and seeing what it
looks like.
